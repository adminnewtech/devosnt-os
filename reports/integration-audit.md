## Self-improvement loop status

1. **Factory Pulse v3** — runs every 15 min, routes work, no human in loop ✅
2. **Factory Health Daily Audit** — flags stale/cost/SLO issues daily ✅
3. **Skill Improvement Weekly Loop** — mines retry_log, proposes prompt fixes + new skills ✅
4. **cross-project-pattern-extractor skill** — runs on every project close ✅
5. **reusable-template-extractor skill** — promotes 3x-repeated patterns to skills ✅
6. **prompt-improvement-review skill** — audits agent prompts, owned by `prompt-optimizer` ✅

The loop is: **failure → retry_log → weekly mining → fix proposal → prompt-optimizer applies**.
